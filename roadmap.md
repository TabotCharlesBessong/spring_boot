Alright, welcome aboard! I'm glad you're taking this step. Moving from the Node.js ecosystem to the Java/Spring world is a fantastic way to broaden your backend capabilities. Your experience with TypeScript, NestJS, and backend architecture will be a massive advantage. Many concepts will be familiar; we'll just be learning a new language, new frameworks, and a different way of thinking about certain problems.

As your mentor on this journey, my goal is to not just teach you syntax, but to impart the "why" behind the Spring ecosystem's design choices, drawing parallels to what you already know.

Let's lay out the roadmap. This is our master plan.

### The Complete Roadmap: From JavaScript Artisan to Java Virtuoso

This roadmap is designed to take you from zero Java knowledge to being a productive Spring Boot developer capable of building a complex, production-ready application. Given your background, we can move faster through conceptual hurdles like "What is an API?" and focus on implementation details.

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 16 Weeks (approx. 4 months)
*This assumes a consistent, part-time commitment of 8-10 hours per week. We can adjust the pace based on your progress.*

---

### **Phase 0: The Foundation - Core Java for the Modern Backend Dev (Weeks 1-2)**

**Objective:** To learn just enough Java to be dangerous and effective in Spring Boot. We will skip the fluff (like desktop UI frameworks) and focus on what's essential for server-side development.

*   **Week 1: Java Syntax and OOP Fundamentals**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Environment Setup:** JDK vs JRE, installing a proper JDK (like Amazon Corretto or OpenJDK), and setting up your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA is the industry standard, and its Community Edition is free).
        *   **Basic Syntax:** Data types (primitives vs. objects), variables, operators, control flow. This will feel very familiar.
        *   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:** Classes, Objects, Constructors. The four pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
        *   **Key Java Features:** `static` vs. instance members, `final` keyword, Interfaces and Abstract Classes.
    *   **Analogy:** Think of Interfaces in Java like Interfaces in TypeScript. They define a contract.
    *   **Practice:** Build a simple command-line application, like a `BankAccount` with methods to `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `checkBalance()`.

*   **Week 2: Essential Java APIs and Tooling**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Java Collections Framework:** `List`, `Set`, `Map`. This is your equivalent of JavaScript Arrays and Objects/Maps.
        *   **Exception Handling:** `try-catch-finally`, checked vs. unchecked exceptions.
        *   **Java 8+ Features (Crucial!):** Lambda Expressions (`->`), Streams API (`.map`, `.filter`, `.collect`), and `Optional`. The Streams API will feel very natural to you, coming from JavaScript's array methods.
        *   **Build Tools:** Introduction to Maven and Gradle. We will use **Maven**. This is the Java equivalent of `npm`/`yarn`. The `pom.xml` file is your `package.json`.
    *   **Practice:** Refactor your `BankAccount` application to manage a `List` of accounts, use a `Map` to store them by account number, and use Streams to perform operations like "find all accounts with a balance over $1000".

### **Phase 1: Entering the Spring Ecosystem - The "Why" (Weeks 3-4)**

**Objective:** To understand the core principles of the Spring Framework itself, before jumping into the "magic" of Spring Boot. This foundational knowledge separates good developers from great ones.

*   **Week 3: The Core of Spring - Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI)**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   What problem does Spring solve? (Managing complexity and coupling).
        *   **Inversion of Control (IoC) Container:** The `ApplicationContext`.
        *   **Dependency Injection (DI):** The single most important concept. We'll cover Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Field Injection.
    *   **Analogy:** You've seen this in NestJS! The way you use `@Injectable()` and inject services into constructors is *exactly* the same principle. Spring pioneered this pattern.
    *   **Practice Project 1: Simple DI Service**
        *   **Goal:** Build a non-web application that uses Spring's `ApplicationContext` to wire together a few components (e.g., a `MessageService` that gets injected into a `MessagePrinter` class).
        *   **Tech:** Java, Spring Context, Maven. **No web server, no database.** Just pure DI.

*   **Week 4: Spring without the Boot - A Glimpse into Web MVC**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   Introduction to Spring MVC architecture (the foundation for web apps).
        *   Annotations: `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Autowired`.
        *   A quick look at how things *used to be* configured (XML) to appreciate what Spring Boot does for us.
    *   **Practice:** Enhance the previous project to be a very basic web application using Spring MVC, but configured mostly manually. This will be a bit tedious, and that's the point! It will make you appreciate Phase 2 all the more.

### **Phase 2: Spring Boot - Rapid Application Development (Weeks 5-8)**

**Objective:** Master the core of Spring Boot for building modern REST APIs. We will build a complete, database-backed application.

*   **Weeks 5-6: Building Your First REST API**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Spring Boot Starters:** The "magic" of auto-configuration.
        *   `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.
        *   Creating REST controllers with `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
        *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** The importance of separating your internal model from your external API contract.
        *   Handling JSON requests and responses.
        *   Basic validation using `hibernate-validator` (`@Valid`, `@NotNull`, etc.).
    *   **Practice Project 2: To-Do List REST API**
        *   **Goal:** Build a full CRUD REST API for a To-Do application.
        *   **Tech:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web, Maven.
        *   **Database:** We'll start with an in-memory database (H2) for simplicity.
        *   **ORM Introduction:** We will introduce **Spring Data JPA** (Java Persistence API) and its implementation, **Hibernate**.
        *   **Key JPA/Hibernate Concepts:** `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `JpaRepository`. You'll be amazed at how you can write `findByTitle(String title)` in an interface and it just *works*.
        *   **Analogy:** Spring Data JPA is your ORM, like Mongoose, Prisma, or TypeORM. An `@Entity` is like a Schema/Model.

*   **Weeks 7-8: Production-Ready APIs**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Connecting to PostgreSQL:** Switching from H2 to a real database. Configuration in `application.properties`.
        *   **Exception Handling:** Global exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice`.
        *   **Spring Security:** This is a big one. We'll start with the basics: securing endpoints with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This will involve creating configuration, filters, and user details services.
        *   **Logging:** A deep dive into proper logging for debugging and monitoring.
    *   **Practice:** Refactor the To-Do List API. Secure all endpoints with JWT. Add user registration and login. Connect it to a real PostgreSQL database.

### **Phase 3: Polishing the Arsenal - Advanced Concepts (Weeks 9-11)**

**Objective:** Move beyond the basics and learn the skills needed to build robust, enterprise-grade applications.

*   **Week 9: Data Relationships and Transactions**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **JPA Relationships:** `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`.
        *   Eager vs. Lazy loading.
        *   **ACID Transactions:** The `@Transactional` annotation. This is a powerful feature for ensuring data integrity.
    *   **Practice:** Evolve the To-Do API. A `User` can have many `TodoList`s, and a `TodoList` can have many `TodoItem`s. Implement the endpoints to manage these relationships.

*   **Week 10: Testing Your Application**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Unit Testing:** Using JUnit 5 and Mockito to test services and components in isolation.
        *   **Integration Testing:** Using `@SpringBootTest` and `TestRestTemplate`/`MockMvc` to test your API endpoints from end-to-end.
    *   **Practice:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the To-Do List API.

*   **Week 11: More Production Topics**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Configuration Management:** Using Profiles (`application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`).
        *   **DTO Mapping:** Using libraries like MapStruct to simplify mapping between Entities and DTOs.
        *   **Basic Caching:** Introduction to `@Cacheable`.
        *   **Containerization:** A brief look at how to Dockerize a Spring Boot application.

### **Phase 4: The Capstone - Full-Stack Virtual Credit Card App (Weeks 12-16)**

**Objective:** Synthesize all your knowledge to build a significant full-stack application.

*   **Weeks 12-14: Backend Development (Spring Boot)**
    *   **Project Scoping & Design:**
        *   **Features:** User Onboarding (KYC), Virtual Card Issuance, View Card Details, Transaction History, Balance Check, Make a (simulated) Payment.
        *   **Data Model:** Design the Postgres schema: `Users`, `Accounts`, `Cards`, `Transactions`, etc.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Build the complete REST API for all features.
        *   Implement complex business logic within `@Service` layers.
        *   Use `@Transactional` heavily to ensure financial operations are atomic (e.g., a payment deducts from a balance and creates a transaction record).
        *   Implement robust security rules (e.g., a user can only see their own cards and transactions).

*   **Weeks 15-16: Frontend Development (React Native) & Integration**
    *   **Frontend Setup:**
        *   You'll take the lead here with your React Native experience.
        *   Set up screens for Login, Dashboard, Card Details, Transactions List.
    *   **Integration:**
        *   Connect the React Native app to your Spring Boot backend.
        *   Implement the full authentication flow, storing JWTs securely on the device.
        *   Fetch and display all data.
        *   Build the forms and logic to perform actions like making a payment.
    *   **Final Polish:** End-to-end testing, bug fixing, and preparing for a final review.
